          Summers can be extremely hot with daytime temperatures exceeding 110
          degrees F (43 degrees C) in the shade, and evening lows averaging 72
          degrees F (22 degrees C). Winters in the Tucson area are delightful
          with mild warm days averaging 65 degrees F (19 degrees C) and cool
          nights averaging 40 degrees F (5 degrees C). Always wear a hat and use
          sunscreen while hiking. Drink plenty of water, we recommend at least
          one gallon of water per person, per day.

          See the graph below to see when visitors choose to visit the Saguaro
          National Park, on average. March is the most comfortable weather,
          resulting in the most average monthly visits.

        <h4>Orange Pipe Cactus</h4>
        <p>
          The organ pipe cactus is a wonderful example of the adaptations that
          cacti need to flourish in the Sonoran Desert. Like its fellow cacti
          and other desert inhabitants, the organ pipe is tuned to the rhythms
          of the sun and the infrequent rains.

        <h4>Prickly Pear Cactus</h4>
        <p>
          Prickly pear cactus represent about a dozen species of the Opuntia
          genus (Family Cactaceae) in the North American deserts. All have flat,
          fleshy pads that look like large leaves. The pads are actually
          modified branches or stems that serve several functions -- water
          storage, photosynthesis and flower production. Chollas are also
          members of the Opuntia genus but have cylindrical, jointed stems
          rather than flat pads.

        <h4>Arizona Mud Turtle</h4>
        <p>
          These attractive but stinky aquatic turtles are rarely seen because
          they are shy and resemble smooth stones. But they are not rare -
          researchers found dozens of individual turtles in a short section of
          Chiminea Creek in the years 2005-2006. Unlike desert tortoises, which
          live only on land and avoid water, Sonoran mud turtles live, breed,
          and forage in the water. When the pools were completely dry, the
          researchers found them resting underground, deep under the roots of
          large cottonwood and ash trees, where they remained until the drought
          ended.

        <h4>Vermilion Flycatcher</h4>
        <p>
          Being almost exclusively insect eaters, these birds tend to move to
          lower elevations during the coldest winter months. They also tend to
          stay pretty close to water, either a riparian stream or a river/pond.
          Here they find plenty of chironomid midges (non-biting, mosquito-like
          flies) and ephemeroptera (mayflies) to catch even during chilly
          weather.
